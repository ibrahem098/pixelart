# Pixel Art Application

This is a web-based pixel art drawing tool inspired by the aesthetics of **Windows 98 Paint**. It uses [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) by Jordan Scales to provide the nostalgic look of the classic OS, while the rest of the implementation was developed by me.

## Features

- **Pixel Grid:** A large 60x30 grid with a total of **1800 pixels**. Each pixel is **20x20px**, allowing for detailed pixel art creation.
- **Color Palette:** The app provides **28 colors** to choose from, letting you paint on the grid.
- **Generate Color Grid:** This feature automatically assigns a random color to each pixel, creating a colorful, randomized grid.
- **Screen Reset (Wipe):** Easily clear the entire grid to start fresh.
- **Bucket Tool:** Select a color and apply it to every pixel on the grid, effectively setting a background color.
- **Color Info:** The app shows the **current selected color** and also displays the **RGB values** of the pixel you hover over.

## Nostalgic UI

The interface is designed to mimic **Windows 98** functionality. Window buttons, borders, and layout all function similarly to the vintage operating system, adding to the retro feel of the tool.
